# WordSearch.jl

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jarvist/WordSearch.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jarvist/WordSearch.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


Simple package for simple custom word-searches for my young children. 

Main code & algorithm forked from: https://github.com/DavidBloomfield/JuliaGames/blob/main/WordSearch/PuzzleGrid.jl

Defaults to lower-case letters, a simple primary-school friendly font, and only
doing horizontal and vertical searches, with no reversing.

Generates a TikZ / LaTeX output for rendering to PDF and printing.
